This is just for a simple class assignment
I made it using Python3 from a terminal, you just need the interpreter to run it.
It uses Python's hash library to demonstrate the principle of hashing passwords. It also demonstrates standard/suggested password selection practices.
Given some password, it hashes it, and then makes a short list of 'guesses' that are 12-16 characters long, each one being randomly an upper- or lower-case letter, number digit, or symbol.
Then it runs a function that takes each of these 'guesses' and to see if any are the correct password, hashes them and compares them to the hash of the original given password.
